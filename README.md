## 1. What is WinRAR?

WinRAR is a trialware file archiver utility for Windows, developed by Eugene Roshal of win.rar GmbH. 

It can create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats and unpack numerous archive file formats. 

WinRAR is not a free software. If you want to use it, you should pay to [__RARLAB__](https://www.rarlab.com/) and then you will get a license file named `rarreg.key`. 

This repository will tell you how WinRAR license file `"rarreg.key"` is generated. 

## 2. How is "rarreg.key" generated?

See [here](README.HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).

## 3. How to build?

If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can also go to the [release page](https://github.com/bitcookies/winrar-keygen/releases/) to get `winrar-keygen.exe`.

### 3.1 Prerequisites

1. Please make sure that you have __Visual Studio 2019__ or the higher. Because this is a VS2019 project.

2. Please make sure you have installed `vcpkg` and the following libraries: 

   * `mpir:x86-windows-static`
   * `mpir:x64-windows-static`

   is installed.

   You can install them by:

   ```console
   $ vcpkg install mpir:x86-windows-static
   $ vcpkg install mpir:x64-windows-static
   ```

3. Your `vcpkg` has been integrated into your __Visual Studio__, which means you have run 

   ```console
   $ vcpkg integrate install
   ```
   
   successfully.

### 3.2 Build

1. Open this project in __Visual Studio__.

2. Select `Release` configuration.

3. Select __Build > Build Solution__.

You will see executable files in `bin/` directory. 

## 4. How to Use?

Execute the following code in the terminal and configure two parameters to generate `rarreg.key`.

Here is an example use `Github` and `Github.com`:

```
Usage:
        winrar-keygen.exe <your name> <license type>

Example:

        winrar-keygen.exe "Github" "Github.com"
  or:
        winrar-keygen.exe "Github" "Github.com" > rarreg.key
```

![Terminal](terminal.png)

Now you can see the newly generated file. 

```console
RAR registration data
Github
Github.com
UID=3a3d02329a32b63da7d8

```

Save the generated information as `rarreg.key`.
